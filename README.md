## About the Project

I created this website to illustrate our beautiful solar system. You can not only navigate to all of the 8 planets and check out some cool stats about them but also edit and delete them. Additionally there's a shop where you can order those objects to an address of your choice.

## The Technologies behind it

A lot of different packages have been used for this project, which can be seen in the requirements.txt file. The project is built on Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, SQLAlchemy and Javascript.
